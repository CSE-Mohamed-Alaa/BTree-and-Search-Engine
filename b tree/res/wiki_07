Stephens Media newspapers
Stephens Media LLC was a Las Vegas Nevada diversified media investment company It owned stakes in the California Newspapers Partnership and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette

The company had been expanding its interactive Internet business operating online sites for its newspapers and portal sites like LasVegascom which is licensed to Greenspun Media Group The company is also a partner in the California Newspapers Partnership with MediaNews and Gannett The company also formed Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC in November 2009 a joint venture with WEHCO Media Inc in Arkansas

On November 28 2010 Stephens Media Iowa LLC a subsidiary of Stephens Media acquired several newspapers including the Ames Tribune Boone NewsRepublican Dallas County News Nevada Journal Ames About People  Advertiser TriCounty Times and Algona Upper Des Moines from Midlands Newspapers Inc a subsidiary of the Omaha WorldHerald Company In August 2011 the Algona Upper Des Moines was sold to Hallmark Media 

In February 2015 Stephens Media was purchased by GateHouse Media for 1028 million In December 2015 GateHouse sold the Las Vegas ReviewJournal the Stephens groups largest paper to casino magnate Sheldon Adelson for 140 million

The company was formerly called Donrey Media Group which was founded by Arkansas media mogul Donald W Reynolds and based in Fort Smith Arkansas After Reynolds died in 1993 at the age of 86 the company was sold to the Stephens family of Arkansas known for their Little Rock investment banking business Stephens Inc Some of Donreys properties were sold off and the company moved its headquarters to Las Vegas Nevada home of its largest newspaper the Las Vegas ReviewJournal The company was renamed Stephens Media Group in 2002 In June 2006 the company became known as Stephens Media LLC The company has no connection with Stephens Media Group a radio broadcasting company in Tulsa Oklahoma

In 2010 Stephens Media contracted with the litigation firm Righthaven LLC giving it the power to enforce the companys copyrights when online violators go beyond the bounds of fair use More than 141 lawsuits have been filed in US District Court in Las Vegas since midMarch

In a column published in the RJ shortly after the lawsuits began publisher Sherman Frederick said the primary goal with the partnership with Righthaven was to deter theft of the companys copyrighted materials He said if the company was successful he hoped Righthaven would find other media clients In late August WEHCO Media which owns the Arkansas DemocratGazette and the Chattanooga Times Free Press signed on with the firm MediaNews Group has also used Righthaven to file a copyright infringement suit

The aggressive enforcement of the Stephens Media copyrights by Righthaven was being closely watched by other publishers as is the debate it has generated Critics of the relatively new practice have coined it copyright trolling and argue that the purpose of such enforcement is to make a profit In the Poynter article Stephens Media general counsel Mark Hinueber says the goal is to make sure the companys intellectual rights are protected We were seeing our entire work product in some stories just being rightclicked and cut and pasted into blogs where people were selling Google ads around them and making money The Las Vegas Sun has been thoroughly documenting Righthavens activities and the response The Suns outside law firm Lewis and Roca is defending several of the Righthaven suits

Targets of the Righthaven lawsuits included bloggers political forums major political parties and several of the newspapers own sources including NORML DailyPaulcom Infowars Free Republic and others On August 25 2010 the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF announced that they will make efforts to assist Righthaven LLC defendants to the best of their ability

Righthavens lawsuits came under increasing judicial scrutiny which led to Righthaven being found in June 2011 to lack standing to sue for alleged infringement of copyrighted material to which it holds only a limited license as such a license does not confer the right to sue for infringement Sanctions against Righthaven and its attorney Steven A Gibson of Nevada law firm Dickinson Wright are currently being contemplated by one judge Righthaven later had its assets seized to pay judgments levied against it in lawsuits it filed against those whom it said infringed on the copyrights of clients As a result copyrights which had been sold by Stephens to Righthaven were sold back to Stephens for 80000 to pay legal fees

In September 2009 Stephens Media and WEHCO Media Inc owner of the Arkansas DemocratGazette announced plans to combine their newspaper operations in Northwest Arkansas and operate as a single company The venture was approved in November 2009 by the US Justice Department and a new Arkansas Limited Liability Company Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC was formed Stephens Media sold its interest in the joint venture to WEHCO on May 5 2016 which assumed control of all operations of the newspapers in the joint venture
