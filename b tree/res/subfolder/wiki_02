The Flying Luttenbachers
The Flying Luttenbachers are an American instrumental unit led by multiinstrumentalist  composer  producer Weasel Walter The Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance Over the course of the band the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter The music has run a gamut from intense allacoustic free improvisation to complex modernistic rock composition electronic noise to punkinspired jazz Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk death metal free jazz and no wave

The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago Illinois as a punk jazz trio with Hal Russell tenor and soprano saxophones trumpet Chad Organ tenor saxophone and Weasel Walter drums The band derived their moniker from Russells birthname Harold Luttenbacher Russell left the band in June 1992 and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers first 7 record

The band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred LonbergHolm Kurt Johnson Jeb Bishop Alex Perkolup Mick Barr Ed Rodriguez Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust Arab On Radar Lightning Bolt US Maple Erase Errata Bobby Conn and Wolf Eyes Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland California in 2003 beginning yet another incarnation of the group The live band played their final concert in November 2006 The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album recorded solo by Walter

In 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn NY on October 1719

Since 1996s Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the selfobliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void a dark silent spectre detailed on 2004s album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes

The Holden Special is a midsize car that was manufactured by Holden for Australasia Introduced as the toplevel trim in the new Holden FJ range of 1953 the Special was complemented by the entrylevel Holden Standard and the midrange Holden Business The Business was in fact already available introduced in July 1953 in the 48 series first seen in 1948 Three months later the FJ was introduced therefore forming a threemodel lineup based around one car A Standardtype variant also existed in the 48 series but had been marketed simply as the Holden

There were also coup utility and panel van variants introduced in 1951 48 and 1953 FJ respectively These were both based on the Standard although neither were badged this way Collectively the two cars were known as the Holden utility and panel van From March 1957 the sedan utility and panel van body styles were complemented by a new fivedoor station wagon The wagon was marketed as the Station Sedan in both Standard and Special trim levels

The Business sedan was deleted from the Holden lineup in mid1959 during the FC production run leaving just the Standard and Special However in 1962 the Holden Premier was introduced with the EJ series becoming the new flagship with the Special assigned as the midrange Holden This model trio continued until the 1968 HK series The Standard became the Belmont the Special the Kingswood with the Premier staying as is A new extendedlength Brougham also joined the lineup becoming Holdens topline offering

Swedish Modernist poetry
Swedish modernist poetry developed in the 1930s and 1940s Distinguishing features where experimentation within a variety of styles usually free prose without rhymes or metric syllables 

The lead figure of the modernists was Hjalmar Gullberg 18981961 He wrote many mystical and Christianity influenced collections such as Andliga vningar Spiritual Exercises 1932 but continued to develop and published his greatest work gon lppar Eyes Lips in 1959 

Other important modernistic poets were Artur Lundkvist 19061991 Gunnar Ekelf 19071968 Edith Sdergran 18921923 and Harry Martinson 19041978 

Gunnar Ekelf has become described as Swedens first surrealistic poet after he debuted with the poetry collection sent p jorden in 1932 a work was too unconventional to become appreciated But Ekelf moved towards romanticism and got betters reviews for his second poetry collection Dedikationen in 1934 A work that became influential for later Swedish poets was his Frjesng in 1941 a finely expressed blend of romanticism surrealism and the dark clouds of the ongoing World War II

Edith Sdergran did not achieve fame during her lifetime but is today regarded as one of the foremost modernistic poets from the Nordic countries and she has been translated into all major languages Her first poetry collection was Dikter in 1916 but it was her second collection Septemberlyran 1918 that caught the attention of a larger audience It is distinguished by a kind of beauty that had not been seen for a long time Sdergran suffered from tuberculosis which took her life as early as 1923

Harry Martinson had an unparalleled feeling of nature in the spirit of Linnaeus As typical for his generation he wrote with a free prosody not bound by rhymes and syllables A classic work was the autobiographical Flowering Nettles in 1935 His most remarkable work was however Aniara 1956 a story of a spaceship drifting through space

The arguably most famous Swedish poet of the 20th century is otherwise Tomas Transtrmer 19312015 His poetry is distinguished by a Christian mysticism moving on the verge between dream and reality the physical and the metaphysical
