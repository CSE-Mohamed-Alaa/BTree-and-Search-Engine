Royal Albert Hall Organ
The Grand Organ situated in the Royal Albert Hall in London is the second largest pipe organ in the United Kingdom It was originally built by Henry Father Willis and most recently rebuilt by Mander Organs having 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes

The original organ was built by Henry Willis  Sons in 1871 It had four manuals and 111 stops and was at that time the largest in the world

The Durham firm of Harrison  Harrison rebuilt the organ in two stages in 1924 and 1933 during which it was increased to 146 stops including three percussion stops and converted to electropneumatic action It was still the largest organ in Britain at that time The 2014 Pink Floyd album The Endless River includes a track Autumn 68 featuring a recording of band member Richard Wright playing the organ in 1969

In the 1970s Harrisons refurbished the console and replaced the switchgear in the action made minor changes to the voicing and added a roof to attempt to project the sound forward which was not successful One interesting note in this period is that composer Wendy Carlos featured the organ during the closing title sequence of the 1982 Disney science fiction film Tron performed by organist Martin Neary

By the end of the 20th century the organ was again in a state of disrepair with an everincreasing number of stops unusable due to leaks in the wind system cracks in the soundboards and other problems By 2002 it was maintained only through heroic efforts on the part of Harrisons and could not be used at all without their staff present in case of mishap The wind chests and pipes were leaking noisily and wind pressure was insufficient to support full use The leatherwork in the actions was also failing

In 2002 the organ was taken out of commission for an extensive rebuild by Mander Organs Some consideration was given to restoring the organ to its original Willis specification but the subsequent alterations and enlargements had made this impractical The organ was by now in truth a Harrison not a Willis instrument and it was felt that it should remain essentially asis

The dryness of the Hall had damaged the soundboards so these were replaced and new and larger wind trunks provided The roof was removed and the reed stops in the Great division were restored to their 1924 wind pressures The 1970s split of the Great Organ allowing two independent Great Organs to be registered and played simultaneously on different manuals was rationalised effectively offering separate Willis and Harrison choruses also a FournitureIV was added bringing the total to 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes For a few years the organ was once again the largest in the UK until in 2007 the distinction passed to the organ in Liverpool Anglican Cathedral 10268 pipes

The organ was reopened at a gala concert on the evening of 26 June 2004 with David Briggs John Scott and Thomas Trotter playing with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Richard Hickox The organ featured prominently in the 2004 BBC Proms series The first recordings on the newly rebuilt instrument were by Dame Gillian Weir The instrument has also been used by progressive rock band Muse when playing Megalomania originally recorded on another Willis organ at the church of Saint Mary in Bathwick During a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall on the 12 April 2008 Muses frontman Matt Bellamy had commented that since were here it would be rude not to play this beast

Although Forest Glade or simply The Glade is an official part of the City of Windsor many residents show a sense of patriotism that would suggest it were an independent town

Forest Glade is well known amongst Windsorites for having many winding and confusing roads It is very easy to get lost in Forest Glade as there are lots of crescents and some of the streets even intersect themselves Numerous crescenttype streets are renamed halfway along them making navigation for people unfamiliar with the area difficult at best

The community is an example of a planned community as until the late 1960s the area was mainly farmland with fewer than a dozen houses in the area The community was built in stages throughout the 1960s 1970s and 1980s with most of the available land between the road boundaries being used The most recent expansion is in the North East corner constructing new houses near Banwell Road
