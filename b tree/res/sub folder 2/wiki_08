Founding Father short story
Founding Father is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov It was first published in the October 1965 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories It was inspired by a cover painting of a spacehelmeted face backed by several crosses provided by the magazines editor Frederik Pohl

An exploratory spacecraft of the Galactic Corps charged with opening up planets for human colonisation sometimes by terraforming crashlands on an alien planet They find that the ecology is heavy in ammonia making the atmosphere unbreathable by humans and the soil unsuitable for the Earthtype plants they have brought for colonisation

As they are unable to take off again the crew spend their time trying to adjust the environment to make it suitable for possible future human colonists by cultivating Earth plants which will create oxygen Although they spend many years at this task they fail and one by one they die of ammonia poisoning 

As the last man dies the flesh of the buried crew feeds the plants and finally helps them to flourish providing the catalyst that alters the environment to become more Earthlike

Hot Water Beach
Hot Water Beach is a beach on Mercury Bay on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula New Zealand approximately 12 kilometres south east of Whitianga and approximately 175 kilometres from Auckland by car Its name comes from underground hot springs which filter up through the sand between the high and low water tidal reaches The beach is a popular destination both for locals and tourists visiting New Zealand Annual visitor numbers have been estimated at 700000 making it one of the most popular geothermal attractions in the Waikato Region

Within two hours either side of low tide it is possible to dig into the sand allowing hot water to escape to the surface forming a hot water pool The water with a temperature as hot as 64C 147F filters up from two underground fissures located close to each other These natural springs can be found on the beach opposite the offshore rocks Visitors often dig large holes and relax and soak in the thermal water Many visitors bring a spade and bucket with them Spades can also be hired from the nearby surf shop

Care needs to be exercised as the location of the hot springs are not far from the sea even at low tide and visitors may be caught unaware by the large breaking waves Hot Water Beach is known for its dangerous rip currents holes and large waves Signs at the beach advise swimmers not to swim within 50m either side of the offshore rocks opposite the springs and to only swim between the flags if the Hot Water Beach Lifeguard Service are on patrol Hot Water Beachs rip currents have claimed the lives of several unwary visitors and only strong and experienced swimmers are advised to enter the water

Rima Ariadaeus
Rima Ariadaeus is a linear rille on the Moon at  It is named after the crater Ariadaeus which marks its eastern end It is over 300 km long and is categorized as a straight rille because of its linear nature 

Some scientists think that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deepseated dike systems when the Moon was still volcanically active Rima Ariadaeus is thought to have been formed when a section of the Moons crust sank down between two parallel fault lines making it a graben or fault trough Rima Ariadaeus shows no trace of associated volcanism and is thus considered to be an end member of the sequence where only pure faulting is involved ie a linear rille

The ridges crossing the rille trough of Rima Ariadaeus and the surrounding plains units have been offset by the trough proving that the ridges are older than the faults Some craters are cut off by the faults and are therefore older Other craters lie on the wall of the trough and are younger than the faulting The faulting must be relatively young because so few craters appear to be younger than the faults and because the edges of the trough appear to be crisp and little affected by slumping and other mass wasting

Apollo mission photographs of the Rima Ariadaeus revealed a 300 kmlong rift line on the surface of the moon On being asked in 2010 about Internet suggestions that this was proof of the Quranic story NASA scientist Brad Bailey said My recommendation is to not believe everything you read on the internet Peerreviewed papers are the only scientifically valid sources of information out there No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two or more parts and then reassembled at any point in the past

The splitting of the moon was reportedly a miracle attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad It is perhaps alluded to in the Quranic verses 5412

Three of Swords
Three of Swords is the third card of the suit of swords The suit is present in Italian Spanish and tarot decks 

This card depicts a fundamentally sorrowful experience tarot readers suggest this may be in the form of a lost relationship an accidental death or some other form of not just depression or malaise but deeply emotional sorrow When the card appears reversed in a spread this is not usually read as meaning the opposite of sorrow but rather a sorrow that is somehow mitigated by its circumstances or that is not as bad as it could have been It is among the most negative cards within the tarot deck
