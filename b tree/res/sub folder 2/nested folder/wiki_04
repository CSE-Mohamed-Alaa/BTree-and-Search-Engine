Social cognitive theory
Social cognitive theory SCT used in psychology education and communication holds that portions of an individuals knowledge acquisition can be directly related to observing others within the context of social interactions experiences and outside media influences This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned In other words people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing but rather the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings

The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from Edwin B Holt and Harold Chapman Browns 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of feeling emotion and desire The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated

In 1941 Neal E Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holts social learning and imitation theory They argued four factors contribute to learning drives cues responses and rewards One driver is social motivation which includes imitativeness the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences Miller and Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement

The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura Bandura along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies known as the Bobo doll experiment in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired and thus built from Miller and Dollards research In Banduras 1977 article he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a persons perceived selfefficacy and behavioral change Selfefficacy comes from four sources performance accomplishments vicarious experience verbal persuasion and physiological states

In 1986 Bandura published his second book which expanded and renamed his original theory He called the new theory social cognitive theory Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors In this book Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal behavioral and environmental influences

In 2001 Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how symbolic communication influences human thought affect and action The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior

In 2011 Bandura published a book chapter  The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theoryto extend SCTS application in health promotion and urgent global issues which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens aiming at improving equality of individuals lives under the umbrellas of SCT

SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior as well as in understanding classroom motivation learning and achievement

Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business The majority of publications using SCT 56 percent come from the field of Applied Health Psychology The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory Campaign topics include increasing fruit and vegetable intake increasing physical activity HIV education and breastfeeding

Born in 1925 Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT His recent work published May 2011 focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior On health Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model focusing on people with problems to a health model focusing on people being healthy and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society Specifically on Population Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planets resources Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use reduce gender inequality through education and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet

Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others These learned behaviors can be central to ones personality While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior the individual person and therefore cognition is just as important People learn by observing others with the environment behavior and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship Each behavior witnessed can change a persons way of thinking cognition Similarly the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors For example a caregivers mindset also cognition determines the environment in which their children are raised

The core concepts of this theory are explained by Bandura through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants 

It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior According to JE Ormrods general principles of social learning while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning it is not absolutely necessary Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one two or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities different individuals and different circumstances

Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective which suggests that instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces individuals are selfdeveloping selfregulating selfreflecting and proactive Specifically human agency operates within three modes

Human agency has four core properties


Evolving over time human beings are featured with advanced neural systems which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory symbolizing capability selfregulation capability selfreflective capability and vicarious capability


Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations

To illustrate that people learn from watching others Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll In the first experiment children were exposed to either an aggressive or nonaggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child There was also a control group The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner while the nonaggressive models played with other toys They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward and that boys were more likely to do so than girls

Following that study Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called Bobo Doll Behavior A Study of Aggression In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it Through this experiment Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior while children not exposed to the video did not This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media In this case the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video

Observations should include 

Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours For instance if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high selfefficacy levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments

To learn a particular behavior people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior called outcome expectancies which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in for example the expected consequences for a DUI in the United States of America are a fine with possible jail time whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty

For example in the case of a student the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students

Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of selfefficacy Selfefficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill Selfefficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation affect and actionwhich operate on action through motivational cognitive and affective intervening processes

According to Bandura selfefficacy is the belief in ones capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations Bandura and other researchers have found an individuals selfefficacy plays a major role in how goals tasks and challenges are approached Individuals with high selfefficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments Individuals with low selfefficacy tend to be less confident and dont believe they can perform well which leads them to avoid challenging tasks Therefore selfefficacy plays a central role in behavior performance Observers who have high level of selfefficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors

Selfefficacy can be developed or increased by 

For example students become more effortful active pay attention highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks

Selfefficacy has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss quitting smoking and recovery from heart attack In relation to exercise science selfefficacy has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise

Identification allows the observer to feel a onetoone similarity with the model and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior

Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race gender age and beyond Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers Bandura 2011 Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work

Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media As Bandura suggested people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports health education and beyond For instance Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gendertyping of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory suggesting that sports media consumption and genderrole socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students

In health communication social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking quit HIV prevention safe sex behaviors and so on For example Martino Collins Kanouse Elliott and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to televisions sexual content and adolescents sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups however no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables

Millers 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender age and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an AIDS campaign to inner city teenagers This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer have a greater sense of selfefficacy and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions
A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants personal  showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve selfefficacy behavioral weekly checkins for three months reinforced participants skills environmental  mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills were more likely to exclusively breastfeed and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program

Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individuals ability to be morally competent and morally performing Moral competence involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior whereas moral performance indicates actually following ones idea of moral behavior in a specific situation Moral competencies include

As far as an individuals development is concerned moral competence is the growth of cognitivesensory processes simply put being aware of what is considered right and wrong By comparison moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way For example a persons moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society however if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory

For the most part social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures as crimes like murder theft and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts Our actions in reallife scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough and nothing else

In series TV programming according to social cognitive theory the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers However in most cases protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the longterm suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individuals attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of onenight stand sex unsafe and risky sexual behavior finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows

Papa Vegas
Papa Vegas is a rock band from the 1990s They released two studio albums and were signed to RCA Records 

Papa Vegas was founded in Grand Rapids Michigan where vocalist Joel Ferguson and guitarist Pete Dunning first began playing together Dunning and Ferguson collaborated for three years before parting ways for individual projects and Ferguson played under the name Papa Vegas with a variety of other musicians After playing with Papa Vegas at a battle of the bands competition they were heard by Brian Vander Ark then lead singer of The Verve Pipe who signed them to his Sid Flips label and produced their debut EP Grounded with Pete Dunning back on lead guitar Scott Stefanski on drums and original bassist Mick Force Sid Flips was folded into RCA and the group was set up with Don Gilmore to produce their debut fulllength album Tom LordAlge mixed the result was released as Hello Vertigo in April 1999 All songs on the album were written by Joel Ferguson with the exception of Sermon Underground which was cowritten by Joel Ferguson and Pete Dunning Their biggest hit single was Bombshell which peaked at 20 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1999 Following the albums release they toured with the Verve Pipe and also Kent a critically acclaimed band from Stockholm then touring the US under RCAs European label and had a lesser hit with the release of Something Wrong but the fulllength did not sell as well as hoped and no further hit singles followed The group was dropped from the RCA label in March 2000 and split up shortly afterward In December 2004 the band reunited to play a large venue show with The Verve Pipe The show was a success and they repeated it in December 2005 Ferguson Stefanski and Dunning regrouped for various projects on and off in the years that followed most notably Miles to Mars Pete Dunning went on to play in the Grand Rapids groups Molly White Rabbit And Barrel Bones while Scott Stefanski and Joel Ferguson played in The Verve Pipe In January 2009 Papa Vegas regrouped as a five piece with John Connors replacing Force on bass and adding Randy Tate on keyboards The band is currently playing shows in their home state of Michigan and is working on a forthcoming album to be released in early 2010 on their own Shiver Music label
