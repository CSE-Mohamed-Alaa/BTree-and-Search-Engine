The Gift is the second episode of the of the American science fiction television series  the 70th episode overall Set in the 24th century the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation The episode marks the last appearance of Kes until the episode 

After  USS Voyager still remains without working warp propulsion and is infested with Borg technology Seven of Nine the Borg drone saved from the destruction of her cube has her connection with the Borg collective severed She is now able to function as an individual but she is shocked by the change and still refers to herself in the first person plural Her body nevertheless starts to heal and reject Borg technology The Doctor decides that he should remove her Borg implants so she can recover

The Doctor hesitates to operate on a patient who refuses medical attention but Captain Janeway who believes that Seven of Nine is unable to make decisions for herself in her current state convinces him to do it During the operation she starts to have a seizure caused by an implant in her brain Kes uses her increasingly powerful telepathic abilities to disable the implant and stop the seizure

The Doctor removes as much of the technology as possible save for those that are too much part of her vital systems but Seven of Nine is upset by the result She is not used to being an individual and she repeatedly demands that she be returned to the Collective Janeway refuses and asks her to help with removing the Borg technology in Voyagers systems

Meanwhile Kes and Tuvok meditate Kes has learned to manipulate matter on a subatomic level and begins to see beyond even that

As Seven of Nine begins her work on repairs she is closely guarded by Harry Kim and a security guard While looking at the hardware Seven sees a transmitter and her Borg impulses are sparked into action by the stimulus She pushes Ensign Kim out of the room shuts the door and barricades herself in the room She accesses a subspace transmitter and tries to send a message to the Borg Kes senses that something is wrong and uses her abilities to send an electrical surge that stops Seven

Seven is held in the brig where she has a long talk with Janeway about her separation from the Collective Meanwhile Neelix and Kes talk about their past She tells him about her new powers and demonstrates them Neelix is hurt as the table they were sitting at starts to change The ships structural integrity begins to destabilize When Janeway and Tuvok enter the room they see Kes on the floor and her body changing  destabilizing at the subatomic level as Tuvok explains The Doctor is unable to explain this reaction he only knows that her powers must be suppressed or she might die

Seven of Nine unsuccessfully tries to break through the brigs forcefield Janeway comes inside her cell with information about her past Before assimilation she was a human girl named Annika Hansen The new information enrages her and her wish to return to the Borg remains unchanged

Kes and Janeway have their last talk and Kes is overcome by her powers warping her very surroundings She cannot control herself and becomes a danger to the ship She and Janeway agree she should leave the ship before it is destroyed Kes boards a shuttle and puts some distance between herself and Voyager

As her atomic structure destabilizes she contacts Voyager and tells them she is about to give them a gift As she vanishes Voyagers warp core begins to function at more than 120 capacity The ship hurtles through space ending up over 9500 light years away in a flash The crew realizes they are safely beyond Borg space and ten years closer to home With their friend Kes far away and on another plane of existence the crew try to accept Seven into their midst Reluctantly she accepts their help and is seen later with most of her Borg implants removed now wearing a bodysuit to conceal the remaining implants and having her blonde hair grown back contemplating her new appearance in closed thoughts

In 2017 Netflix announced that The Gift was among the top ten most rewatched Star Trek episodes on their streaming service excluding the first two episodes of each series

Penicillium crustosum
Penicillium crustosum is a bluegreen or bluegrey mold that can cause food spoilage particularly of proteinrich foods such as meats and cheeses It is identified by its complex biseriate conidiophores on which phialides produce asexual spores It can grow at fairly low temperatures it is a psychrophile and in low water activity environments

Penicillium crustosum produces mycotoxins most notoriously the neurotoxic penitrems including the best known penitrem toxin penitrem A and including penitrems A through G Penitrem G has been shown to have insecticidal activity In addition P crustosum can produce thomitrems A and E and roquefortine C Consumption of foods spoiled by this mold can cause transient neurological symptoms such as tremors In dogs symptoms can include vomiting convulsion tremors ataxia and tachycardia

HexapodTelescope
The HexapodTelescope HPT is a telescope located at Cerro Armazones Observatory in northern Chile The RitcheyChrtien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts an arrangement known as a Stewart platform This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity As a result the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high Furthermore the sixleg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapodmounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts

The mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum AIRUB in Germany Led by Prof Rolf Chini the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB In 2006 it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile AIRUB in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North UCN is developing an observatory there A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones

Together with the Landessternwarte HeidelbergKnigstuhl AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical BESO for the HPT It is a copy of the Fiberfed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph FEROS operated by the European Southern Observatory
