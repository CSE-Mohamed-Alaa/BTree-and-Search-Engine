Fosters first collection of novellas was wellreceived and his first novel The Pure Land 1974 won the inaugural The Age Book of the Year prize The novel is strongly autobiographical as it traces the experiences of the young scientist Danny Harris in America and Australia At the end of the novel Danny has abandoned science and appears to be inventing the novel in which he is a character His grandfather Albert Manwaring has left his life as a photographer in Katoomba to seek success and finally spiritual purity in America Danny born in America reverses the journey to find a Pure Land in Australia The novel satirises both the grasping materialism of America and the backward colonialism of Australia This novel was followed by another collection of stories Escape to Reality 1977 which pursued Fosters interest in masculine irresponsibility and the paradoxes of science and art With a fellow scientist at the Australian National University called DK Lyall Des Kirk Foster published The Empathy Experiment 1977 a strange exploration of paranoia in the context of scientific experiments in empathy

A 1978 Marten Bequest enabled Foster to travel to Scotland to research Moonlite 1981 his acclaimed satire on colonialism which places the experiences of Scottish islanders during the clearances of the nineteenth century in paradoxical comparison with the colonising of Australia at the same time Plumbum 1983 uses Fosters experience in jazz bands to satirise the contemporary Western adulation of rock musicians contrasting this fervour with the various religions of Bangkok and India The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross 1985 is a burlesque historical satire on the paradoxes of religious belief following the picaresque adventures of Christian as he searches for the philosophers stone Dog Rock a Postal Pastoral 1985 offers a more benign comedy as Foster examines the trivia of an Australian country town like Bundanoon A second Dog Rock novel The Pale Blue Crochet Coathanger Cover 1988 continues this nostalgic view of a disappearing rural life with particular reference to the misuse of animals and in 2012 Foster published a third Dog Rock novel Man of Letters Testostero 1987 inspired by a residence in Venice in 1984 uses the convention of the separated twins to satirise the cultural differences between Britain and Australia with a third possibility represented by Italy Among its many allusions and parodies the novel invokes the traditions of Carnivale and Carlo Goldonis playThe Venetian Twins

After the Australian Bicentennial celebrations of 1988 Foster published his own satire of the state of contemporary Australia in Mates of Mars 1991 The novel follows a group of martial arts enthusiasts as they travel from Sydney to the Northern Territory and encounter a spiritualism that challenges their various beliefs and attitudes The characters represent a multicultural Australia and demonstrate the novels premise that Australians are not just members of the internal proletariat ofWestern Christian Civilisation  a civilisation now decrepit that can never take Colonials seriously but also in certain key aspects chiefly but not exclusively economic barbarian members of the external proletariat of the Sinic Mahayana Buddhist Civilisation in its Westernised JapaneseKoreanColonial Chinese branch on the southernmost march of that civilisation

Foster used the support of an Australian government Creative Fellowship awarded in 1991 a Keating award to research his monumental The Glade Within the Grove 1996 Narrated by the postman of Dog Rock DArcy DOliveres this novel examines the destruction of the native forests of Australia and the decline of Christianity in the context of preChristian religious beliefs Set mainly in the revolutionary year of 1968 the novel speculates about a group of hippies who set up a commune in the South Eastern forests of Australia The novels accompanying poemThe Ballad of Erinungerah claims to be the work of a child of the commune and describes the visit of the goddess Brigid and her demand that the men castrate themselves The novel celebrates the forests in lyrical descriptions satirises the stupidity of the communards and translates snatches of classic texts into Australian vernacular It is celebratory satirical and elegiac Later Foster published under his own name an essay On Castration in Heat magazine that incorporated part of the novel as it argued that male sexuality is a destructive force that needs to be controlled This obsession is evident in all Fosters work after Mates of Mars His novel In the New Country offers a comic and despairing view of the decline of rural life in Australia comparing it to the corresponding decline of spirituality in the Old Country of Ireland The Land Where Stories End is a fairytale about a woodcutter in Ireland who goes on an impossible quest for spiritual purity 

In 2009 Foster published Sons of the Rumour his most ambitious and original novel to date Modelled on the structure of the One Thousand and One Nights it changes the storytellers role from Shahrazad to a group of men travelling through the 7th century city of Merv Richard Burtons Arabian Nights are transformed into Iranian days Foster creates a comic structure for the stories with his rather Australian bickering couple the Shah and Shahrazad but the stories are imaginative adventures sometimes puzzling sometimes grotesque and often wondrous For example The Mine in the Moon imagines a world without women where boys grow up without maternal comfort The Tears of the Fish describes an orgy and castration ritual The Gilt Felt Yurt measures the loss of freedom in the creation of civilization and settlement In the course of the stories the Shah undergoes an education in spiritualism and sexual understanding A final section of the novel moves to the present day where a modern man undergoes a visionary experience in Ireland Reviewing the novel for Australian Book Review James Ley concluded There is simply no one remotely like him in contemporary Australian fiction He is so far ahead of everyone else that its not funny Except that it is funnyvery very funny
