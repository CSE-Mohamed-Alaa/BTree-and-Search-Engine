Source routing
In computer networking source routing also called path addressing allows a sender of a packet to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network In contrast in conventional routing routers in the network determine the path incrementally based on the packets destination Another routing alternative label switching is used in connectionoriented networks such as X25 frame relay ATM and MPLS

Source routing allows easier troubleshooting improved traceroute and enables a node to discover all the possible routes to a host It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel over one path to prevent congestion on another

Many highperformance interconnects including Myrinet Quadrics IEEE 1355 and SpaceWire support source routing

In the Internet Protocol two header options are available which are rarely used strict source and record route SSRR and loose source and record route LSRR Because of security concerns packets marked LSRR are frequently blocked on the Internet If not blocked LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof its address but still successfully receive response packets

In IPv6 two forms of source routing have been developed The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header  This routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options Unfortunately there were several important attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated A more secure form of source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing

Softwaredefined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane Studies have shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by the controller into the network

When using source routing with Myrinet the sender of the packet prepends the complete route one byte for every crossbar to each packet header
Each crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet
When using source routing that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar when that port becomes available the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Each packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing source routing or logical addressing or some combination
The router examines the first data character of the packet when it indicates some specific port of the router the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Sauce Amricaine
Sauce amricaine is a recipe from classic French cookery containing chopped onions tomatoes white wine brandy salt cayenne pepper butter and fish stock It is sometimes known as sauce armoricaine which is the original name derived from Armorica the ancient name for a region of France including Brittany which is known for its fishing

Louis Saulnier gives the following recipe

Amricaine  Treat as for Lobster Amricaine Pound shells and meat in the mortar and incorporate equal quantity of fish velout add butter

As with many other classic dishes the original recipe has been adapted over time and almost every chef will prepare the sauce in a slightly different way Modern recipes usually include tarragon will use lobster stock rather than pounded lobster and often replace cayenne pepper with paprika

SaturnShuttle
The SaturnShuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using the Saturn V rocket It was studied and considered in 19711972

An interstage would be fitted on top of the SIC stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the SII stage in the Saturn V It was an alternative to the SRBs

The addition of wings and some form of landing gear on the SIC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center where technicians would then refurbish the booster by replacing only the five F1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights

The Shuttle would handle space station logistics while Saturn V would launch components 
This would have allowed a space station using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports to have been lifted with just a handful of launches The SaturnShuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters that ultimately precipitated the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986

Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank and the need to prevent damage to the delicate thermal protection tiles the fiveengine variant of the SaturnShuttle would require the center engine to be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to staging Once the SIC was jettisoned the three onboard highenergy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel the orbiter into LEO shutting down 65 minutes after ignition The external tank would then be jettisoned as on the actually flown shuttle configuration and the orbiter would then perform its mission

But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program in 1972 NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket instead of the SIC thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed

Westminster Christian Academy Georgia
Westminster Christian Academy WCA is a K12 private college preparatory Christian school Its campus is located at 1640 New High Shoals Road in Watkinsville Oconee County Georgia United States

Westminster Christian Academy was founded in the fall of 1988
 The schools initial class was composed of 10 first second and third grade students meeting in rented space at Faith Presbyterian Church in Watkinsville taught by Karen Schaefer The school grew alongside the oldest students in this first class adding a new grade level after each school year

In 1994 enrollment in the school outgrew the capacity of its facilities at Faith Presbyterian As a result the schools lower grades K4 remained at Faith and the higher grades 58 the highest grade offered at the time moved to facilities at Watkinsville First Baptist Church WCAs first high school class graduated in the spring of 1999

The school completed the first phase of development at its present location a site in Oconee County in the fall of 1998 An additional expansion has been planned that would add a new gymnasium and bring the schools capacity to 500 students

The school enrolled 270 students across all grades for the 20112012 academic year

WCAs facilities include an administration building which also houses the library a lowerschool building which houses PreK through fifth grade an upperschool building with a gymnasium and a fitness center which houses the middle grades and Westminster High School a field house containing two class rooms and three athletic fields The gymnasium houses ten classrooms

Uniforms are required on four out of five days for middle through high school on casual Friday students can wear nontorn jeans and Tshirts A chapel is held every Thursday at separate times for K5 and 612 where all students sing and listen to a guest speaker

WCA is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and has a dual accreditation with the Southern Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools

WCAs athletics teams compete in Region 1A of the Georgia Independent School Association The school sponsors teams in the following sports

The school claims that nearly 75 of the student body participates in an officially sanctioned sport

Northgate Mall San Rafael
Northgate Mall is a shopping mall located in San Rafael California north of the Golden Gate Bridge Its the largest of three shopping centers in San Rafael called Northgate It is managed by The Macerich Company It is the only enclosed regional shopping center in Marin County The malls anchors are Macys and Kohls with a vacant anchor last occupied by Sears It also contains a Century Theatres multiplex a food court and more than 90 specialty stores services and restaurants

The original anchor in the corner occupied by Macys was The Emporium which opened in 1964 When the rest of the mall opened in 1965 it had an openair design The mall was enclosed when it was renovated in 1987

MTR Properties Inc was the original owner Macerich bought the mall in 1985 before selling it to Merlone Geier Partners in 2017

On January 4 2018 Sears announced that its store at the mall will be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide The store closed in April 2018 Around the same time plans were announced that would transform the mall into a town center 

Macerich began renovating the mall in 2008 The proposed renovation has been controversial as housing advocates have pushed for inclusion of affordable housing in the project to replace the aging housing in the Canal Area while Macerich chose to proceed without triggering a fullscale environmental review
